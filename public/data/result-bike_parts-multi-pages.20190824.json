With its unidirectional carbon construction (with exception of final cosmetic layer), 3.6 mm stack height, industry leading strength to weight ratio and Bont\u2019s proprietary resin allowing customization of fit, the a-one will ensure that your power is transferred straight to the drive train without waste.\n\n\nHeat Molding Process \n\nThis cycling boot is the most heat mold-able boot on the market today. Bonts\u2019 resin is developed in house and has been perfected over 35 years to be an extremely stiff resin that becomes pliable at relatively low temperatures. The base of the boot is mold-able which means all stiff areas of the boot can be molded in a standard oven. You do not need to mold your boots if they fit you straight out of the box. \n\nTo mold your boots, remove any cleats, laces or cleat mounting screws and innersole before molding. Failure to remove the innersole can result in it becoming deformed by the heat. Pre heat the oven to 70C/160F. Place the boot in the oven for 20 minutes. Higher temperatures will void your warranty and may damage your boot. \n\nCaution: Do not place your feet in the hot boots or you may burn your feet. Let them cool a little and test the boot temperature with your hand before placing your feet in the boots. Tighten the straps and allow to cool. If you have any lumps or bunions on your feet or if there are any areas causing discomfort, while the boot is hot you can use the round end of a screwdriver to press out any part of the boot. You can heat mold the boots as many times as you like.\n\nSpecifications\n\nBrand\tBont\nModel A-One\nSize 39 EU  / 6 US\nColor\tWhite with Black\nWeight (g)\t503\nFastening Type\tVelcro\n\nThanks for looking!

THESE BICYCLES ALMOST NEVER COME UP FOR SALE! \n\nHistory: \nRon Cooper started building frames for Gillotts of London around 1950. He opened his own London shop in 1971, and continued to build the highest quality frames for an extremely demanding and exclusive clientele until his death in 2012.  That is well over 60 years of frame-building experience.  -- The build date of this frame is unknown, but (based on stylistic elements and materials) it is probably late-1980s through mid-1990s. \n\nSerial number 284. \n\nThis frameset is built with Reynolds 531 double-butted tubing. The lug-work is impeccable and refined. The frame is extremely light. It was professionally measured and aligned before being repainted. \n\nThe frameset has been custom repainted in an absolutely elegant \u201cIce Blue\u201d that compliments the Cooper graphics beautifully. The frameset has not been built up since re-painting, but displayed for a while in my office. However, the frame does not fit me, and I cannot justify keeping it as a beautiful \u201cwall-hanger\u201d any longer. \n\nThe paint and graphics are in near-mint condition. There are slight imperfections in the frame/finish: a barely perceptible indentation in the top tube, a small dent in the side of drive-side fork, and a minor imperfection in the paint finish on the inside of the other fork. These issues are shown in the photos. They in no way detract from the frame\u2019s beauty or functionality. \n\nMeasurements: \nSeat Tube: 58cm/approx. 23\u201d center to top // 57cm center to center\nTop Tube: 56cm \nRear Spacing: 126mm\nSeat Tube: 27.2mm \nBottom Bracket: 68mm shell with 1.37\u201d x 24tpi threading \nHeadset (INCLUDED): Tange Levin steel headset (high-quality, Campagnolo Record look-alike)  \n\n$400 OBO \n\n\nFYI: I restore vintage steel bicycles to their original glory as a hobby. I charge only for the parts and materials I have in the bike. I do not charge for my many hours of labor, including custom, hand-rubbed paint jobs.  I have restored over three dozen vintage bicycles in the last five years.  Many of those have been ridden at L\u2019Eroica California. \n\n\nWHEN RESPONDING, PLEASE LEAVE YOUR NAME AND A PHONE/TEXT NMBER. I DO NOT RESPOND TO ONLINE OR EMAIL OFFERS.

I've got 4 live courses from Racermater (Kona, IM Arizona, IM Canada, Wildflower) but honestly if you are in the market for a smart trainer then I expect you will be hooking it up to something like Zwift! \n\nEither through the head unit or Zwift you can see power and cadence info. \n\nAs with other smart trainers, when you ride on Zwift, it will vary the resistance based on the in-game terrain. So cool. \n\nThis is a very affordable entry level trainer and it is built like a tank!\n\nCash and local pick up only.    ", "Address": "morgan hill"},

As far as resistance training, the Elite Drivo is connected directly to the bicycle chain which accurately transmits the athletes generated power. This model uses innovative pulleys and highly resistant transmission belts so every pedal effort is evenly transferred to the resistance unit.

I'm selling it because I accidentally ordered the wrong size for my bikes' seat-posts. If you're not familiar with seat post pumps, this is an ingenious way to hide a pump functionally in the framework of a bicycle, while making it even more usable by employing the seat itself as the pump handle. With the added benefit that there's no obvious bike pump strapped to the frame where it can come loose or fall off while riding, or be easily stolen if left in place while the bike is parked. Plus the seat post size is much larger than the standard mini-pump sizes, making quicker & easier work of the pumping as well. (Bicycle seat itself not included -- this works like standard seat posts with any standard bicycle seats.)\n\nAs the manufacturer, Biologic, says: \n\"Never forget your bike pump at home again. The BioLogic PostPump 31.6mm seatpost is an ingenious combination of a seatpost and powerful floor pump. The pump mechanism is hidden inside the seatpost and uses the seatpost as the outer wall of the pump. Go over 100 psi in less than half the strokes of the best mini-pumps. The PostPump is always ready, hidden from the elements and thieves.\"\n\nJust make sure that you have a bike with a 31.6mm seat post, which isn't a standard size -- not that there is one standard size, anyway. But if you have a foldable bike like a newer Dahon or a Tern, you may have the right-sized seat post for this seat post pump to fit. Just measure the diameter of your current seat post (or of the post-opening in the frame) to check it out.\n\nCash only please.    ", "Address": "alameda"},

SIDI's famously reliable and replaceable closures are improved by an all new proprietary SIDI Wire material that is completely nonbinding for intuitive and effortless on-the-fly adjustments. Like most SIDI small parts, the TECNO-3 SYSTEM is serviceable and replaceable. \n\nThe SOFT INSTEP CLOSURE SYSTEM is a wide, anatomically curved strap combined with a soft, thermoformed EVA pad that distributes pressure evenly over the instep area. The SOFT INSTEP CLOSURE SYSTEM is adjustable from both sides, to perfectly center the EVA pad over a high or low instep. The system eliminates the need for the High Instep Extender. The SOFT INSTEP CLOSURE SYSTEM is replaceable.\n\nHIGH SECURITY VELCRO straps with integrated locking polymer teeth, that engage onto each other when the strap is closed. This feature makes the closure more secure and the strap becomes unmoveable.\n\nThe ADJUSTABLE HEEL RETENTION DEVICE reinforces the top of the heel cup and improves the fit by closing the back of the shoe securely around the rider's heel. The heel retention device tightens the top of the heel cup so that the heel doesn't slide out during steep climbs or sprints. Each side of the heel can be adjusted independently, for a perfect fit. For a custom adjustment turn the screw towards the + sign to tighten the heel retention device and towards the - sign to open it. Light weight, easy to use, and replaceable.\n\nReinforced SIDI HEEL CUP that stabilizes and supports the heel. Anatomically shaped plastic, reduces heel slip and provides increased power transfer. Provides additional foot protection in the event of a crash.\n\nIn 1999, SIDI revolutionized mountain bike shoe design with the SOLE REPLACEMENT SYSTEM (SRS), owing mountain bikers to replace the most wear-heavy part of the shoe--the sole. The MTB SRS CARBON COMPOSITE SOLE consists of four inserts screwed, easily removable and replaceable. In addition, an optional toe guard can be installed using the same screws as the insert. The SRS tread panels and screws are available as spare parts. It is toe spike compatible.\n\nIf the listing is still up, it's available\n    ", "Address": "san carlos"},

From what I can tell, it is very similar to the F1B sold today:\nhttps://hollywoodracks.com/collections/trunk-bike-racks/products/f1b-original-trunk-rack?variant= \n\n\nThe F1B, designed in 1973, is our original fully pre-assembled and foldable single or multi-bike trunk rack. This rack is virtually indestructible and the classic design means it can be installed on most cars, vans and SUVs. Multi-position hinges makes it super simple to get the F1B on an off your vehicle and it can be folded flat when not in use. It carries up to 3 bikes and the integrated tie-down straps ensure your bikes get safety and securely to your destination with ease.\n\n- Capacity: Three Bikes (Max. 35 lbs per bike)\n- Fits most vehicles\n- Easy to use multi-position hinges allow fast and simple installation\n- Comes fully pre-assembled\n- Folds flat for easy storage\n- Integrated tie-down strap for extra security\n\nFor questions, check out these installation instructions:\nhttps://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0690/4863/files/2018_F1B_-_F4_instructions.pdf?9879686991522417824\n\n\nCONDITION\nGreat condition, probably around 10 years old. The non-black metal pieces have a little oxidation but are completely functional. The narrow foam tape strips to protect your bike frame from the rack are coming unstuck but could be easily replaced. \n\n\nINTERESTED?\nFeel free to contact me with any questions (please see the installation instructions linked above first) or your best offer.

The Minion DHF was designed for the loose and muddy conditions that riders often encounter. The DHF incorporates ramped knobs for low rolling resistance and channel-cut knobs to increase gripping edges to deliver straight-line control and precise cornering. When this is combined with a single ply casing you get an incredibly aggressive all mountain tire in a lightweight package that excels in loose and loose over hard pack trail conditions. \n\nFeatures: \n\nTUBELESS READY: Tubeless tires provide the rider with many benefits: the ability to run lower air pressures, which improves traction; lower rolling resistance when compared to a tube-type tire; and less chance of flatting since there is no tube. Maxxis Tubeless Ready (TR) tires provide the benefits of a UST tubeless tire without the weight penalty. TR tires use a standard casing and require the use of a liquid sealant in order to make them airtight. Maxxis Tubeless Ready tires are the only Maxxis tires approved for use with liquid sealants. Using a liquid sealant in any non-TR Maxxis tire will void the warranty.\n3C TRIPLE COMPOUND - MOUNTAIN: Maxxis 3C Triple Compound mountain technology uses a harder, longer lasting base layer and two progressively softer top layers in order to optimize traction and stability. Maxxis offers three different configurations of 3C Triple Compound mountain technology: Maxx Speed, Maxx Terra and Maxx Grip.\nMAXX TERRA: An intermediate compound configuration used in select mountain tires. 3C Maxx Terra is softer and offers more traction than 3C Maxx Speed, yet provides better treadwear and less rolling resistance than Maxx Griip\n    ", "Address": "campbell"},

Perhaps you like more surface area than the standard XT pedals offer. These Shimano XT PD-M785 Pedals have an integral cage that gives you a greater area to hit when you have to \"stab\" at them in the heat of the moment. You'll also be able to count on more support for your foot as you pedal. If you ride in anything softer than uber-stiff carbon soled shoes, this is where you'll notice the greatest benefit.As usual, the workhorse XT parts get some trickledown from Shimano's flagship XTR line. The shape of the cage is very similar to the more expensive XTR parts; and at a glance, they look identical. The retention mechanism functions exactly the same. For your hard-earned dollars, there is no comparison for XT pedals. They'll always give you the best performance-per-dollar. The key difference is seen on the gram scale. XTR is significantly lighter thanks to their use of higher grade materials and subtle trimming of excess fat. And for this caged version, you'll gain about 30 grams per pedal over the standard-sized XT PD-M780 Pedals. Like all other Shimano SPD pedals, it's a two-sided design so you can have easy access with the stomp of your foot. The two-bolt SH-51 cleats (included) have 4 degrees of float to allow some movement in your ankle as you pedal. The Shimano XT PD-M785 Pedals are Dark Grey and have an aluminum body that relies on sealed cartridge bearings to spin on a plated chromoly axle. The retention mechanism can be adjusted on both sides to accommodate your preferred release tension.    ", "Address": "rohnert pk / cotati"},

A professional level racing frame, proven in the Spring Classics in Europe, the CX-Zero strikes a perfect balance between performance and comfort. \n\nThe most versatile Colnago model, the CX-Zero has been developed to meet the demands of cycling in the greatest range of conditions.  \u201cClassic\u201d geometry for fit combines a taller head tube and slightly shorter top tube. This allows a more relaxed position of the shoulders and arms and a more open angle between the torso and thigh for more efficient pedaling during even the longest days in the saddle.\n\nThe tube shapes of the rear triangle are designed to offer maximum vertical compliance while allowing clearance for up to 25mm tires. The seatpost is a smaller 27.2mm diameter. \n\nAll of these features promise more rider comfort and less fatigue. Your last mile will be as enjoyable as your first on the CX-Zero, on the most epic rides and on the most challenging roads.\n\n\nSimilar to pinarello, italia, enve, campagnolo, shimano, sram, dura-ace, ultegra, record, roval, specialized, venge, tarmac, allez, roubaix, trek, madone, emonda, zipp, oltre, specialissima, bianchi, bmc, timemachine, teammachine, supersix, evo, cannondale, c60, c59, v2r, v1r, ferrari, c64, clx, cervelo, cinelli, felt, fuji, giant, gt, kestrel, look, di2, etap, disc, dogma, f8, f10, scott, addict, epic, aero, race, road, hed, tcr, oclv, ocr, mapei, rapha, bontrager, aeolus, pro, chris king, ceramicspeed, power, phenom, mimic, supacaz, lizardskin, garmin, pioneer, powertap, stages, fsa    ", "Address": ""},

They are not Strike, Assault, or ARX series which use lower end hubs and design. \n\nThe Blacklabel Series Aero DB use Premium Industry Nine Torch series hubs which run $600+ alone. Only the best Reynolds has to offer. \n\nThese wheels are fast and light. They are the perfect depth size at 46mm. you can feel the aero at high speeds, they take off quickly and are stiff for power transfer. They are lighter than ENVE 4.5 which come in at 1569g compared to the Aero 46DB at 1525g so also a great climbing wheel. The DET is not a marketing gimmick and really work to combat crosswinds well. It\u2019s been lab tested against DT Swiss and Zipps with good results. Link to reviews is below. \n\nhttps://intheknowcycling.com/2018/09/16/reynolds-aero-46-db/\n\nhttps://www.roadbikereview.com/reviews/reynolds-aero-46-db-wheels-review\n\nThe current MSRP is $2,100 without tires. 2018 MSRP was $2,600. They go head to head with Zipp 404 and Enve 4.5. Reynolds LIFETIME warranty and crash protection is legendary and they are well known to accommodate second hand owners. \n\nhttps://reynoldscycling.com/collections/aero-wheels\n\nThe wheels are as modern as they come. These are not carbon wheels merely adapted from rim brake to disc. They are current generation design that is optimized for disc brakes and tubeless. The wide inner width of 19mm will increase the air volume in tubeless which reduces rolling resistance and increases comfort by reducing PSI. Once you go tubeless, there is no going back. It\u2019s the best puncture protection and fastest tire on the market. It automatically self-seals most punctures and any large punctures will take less than 3 minutes to repair with a Dynaplug without removing the tire or wheel. \n https://www.bicyclerollingresistance.com/\n\nThe main issue with tubeless is setup. It\u2019s not easy. Therefore these are already setup tubeless! It can be easily converted back to tubed as well. (Wipe sealant, remove tubeless valve, and stick a tube in) \n\nThese wheels are setup thru axel 12x100mm and 12x142mm, QR adapters are available everywhere. Currently setup center-lock disc brakes but adapters are available everywhere to 6-bolt.  The tubeless tape and sealant are fresh.  I will include the Orange Seal Kit tubeless setup with Schwalbe Pro One 700c x 28mm tires. The rear is used about 500 miles, the front is about 150 miles. \n\nWheel condition: \n8/10. Some scratches from transport. I learned to never again use a hanging rear bike rack with other bikes. Pictures will have close ups of scratches. \n\nWhat is NOT INCLUDED are the brake rotors, Garmin sensor, and cassette. \n\n\n\n\nKey Features\n\u2022\tIndustry leading aerodynamic performance and cross wind stability with our Dispersive Effect Termination (DET\u2122) rim profile\n\u2022\tWide, tubeless ready rim provides better fit for higher volume tires that increase grip, lower rolling resistance and provide greater comfort\n\u2022\tPrecision manufactured Reynolds hubs by Industry Nine for quick engagement and efficient transfer of power\n\u2022\tPremium Sapim CX-Ray bladed spokes offer ultimate performance in weight and ride quality paired with internal, alloy nipples\n\u2022\tDisc and rim brake specific models available\n\u2022\tCtg2 brake track is 30% more resistant to heat than previous models\n\u2022\tLifetime warranty\n\nSpecifications\n\u2022\tInner Rim Width: 19MM\n\u2022\tOuter Rim Width: 28MM\n\u2022\tRim Depth: 46MM\n\u2022\tSpokes: F20 | R24\n\u2022\tSpoke Pattern: Front 2x | Rear 2x\n\u2022\tWeight: 1525g\n\u2022\tTechnology: CR6, DET\n\u2022\tHub: Front i9 | Rear i9\n\u2022\tSpoke Type: CX-Ray\n\u2022\tNipple: Internal 5mm Hex Alloy\n\u2022\tEngagement: 6\u00b0\n\u2022\tPawl: 3\n\u2022\tDecal: Black water slide\n\u2022\tRim: Aero 46 Carbon Tubeless Disc Brake\n\n    ", "Address": "walnut creek"},

Tighten it in place, and that's it\u2014 you're done! After an initial break-in period you might notice your bicycle performing less responsively than the day you brought it home. Not to worry, this is typical of all new bicycles and simply reflects that cables have stretched or their housings have seated themselves into final position. To keep running at peak performance, all REI bicycles come with a FREE tune-up, which should be accomplished between the first 100-200 miles of riding or after the first two months if you're accumulating miles less quickly. \n\nTechnical specs\n\nBest Use\tRecreational Cycling\nFrame\tSteel with step-through geometry\nBike Suspension\t\nNo Suspension\nFork\tUni Crown Steel\nCrankset\tRatrod OPC\nBottom Bracket\t9 PC Loose Ball\nShifters\tShimano Nexus 3-speed\nRear Cogs\t22T\nBrake Type\tCoaster Brake\nBrakes\tCoaster\nRims\tAlloy\nFront Hub\tAlloy 36H\nRear Hub\tShimano Coaster/3-speed\nWheel Size\t26 inches\nTires\t26 x 2.125\nHandlebar Shape\tMoustache Bar\nHandlebar\tBullhorn\nStem\tAlloy Classic\nSeat Post\tClassic steel pillar\nSaddle\tCustom with metal coil springs\nPedals\tPlatform\nHeadset\t1\" steel threaded\nChain\tKMC 410\n\nCome take a look!\n\nThanks and Happy C Listing!

These are well worn, but they are in great shape for more fun out in the woods.  Put these guys back on the trail!  \nFeel free to make an offer.\n\nCONTROL TECH STIX TEAM ISSUE\nThere is a remaining variation of the Control cinch type bar ends. The Team Issue set is a dual position L-bend set of bar ends that were originally designed to be sold by another company in the bike industry that makes helmets and sells tires. When they passed on the design, Control Tech wisely decided to market the design under their own name. The Team Issue is made using the same raw materials and techniques as the Lite series. The cinch assembly is made identically to the Lite I cinch, except when it's turned on the lathe, the aluminum extrusion is cut so it contours the cinch bolt head more closely, reducing weight. The cinch bolt and nutsert are the same the Lite I. The grip tubing is made of two pieces of 6061 T-6 aluminum tubing, with a wall thickness that was micrometered to 1.6mm thick. The primary grip section is miter cut to closely fit the cinch section at the time they are TIG welded together. The primary grip section like the Lite models is welded at a 15 degrees from handlebar perpendicular inward, toward the front tire. It has 2 1/4\" inches of knurled surface centered between the ends.

Put these guys back on the trail!  \nFeel free to make an offer.\n\nCONTROL TECH STIX TEAM ISSUE\nThere is a remaining variation of the Control cinch type bar ends. The Team Issue set is a dual position L-bend set of bar ends that were originally designed to be sold by another company in the bike industry that makes helmets and sells tires. When they passed on the design, Control Tech wisely decided to market the design under their own name. The Team Issue is made using the same raw materials and techniques as the Lite series. The cinch assembly is made identically to the Lite I cinch, except when it's turned on the lathe, the aluminum extrusion is cut so it contours the cinch bolt head more closely, reducing weight. The cinch bolt and nutsert are the same the Lite I. The grip tubing is made of two pieces of 6061 T-6 aluminum tubing, with a wall thickness that was micrometered to 1.6mm thick. The primary grip section is miter cut to closely fit the cinch section at the time they are TIG welded together. The primary grip section like the Lite models is welded at a 15 degrees from handlebar perpendicular inward, toward the front tire. It has 2 1/4\" inches of knurled surface centered between the ends. The secondary grip section is TIG welded to the primary section, so that it tips upward at a 14 degree angle as it bends further inward toward the tire an additional 53 degrees from the original 15\u00a1 welded into the primary grip section. The Team Issue bar ends come with Rodon plugs in the grip section tubing, and an another pair for use as handlebar end plugs. The Team Issue bar ends come in a Blue, Black, Green, Lavender, Titanium Grey or Silver anodized finish. With their steel bolts and all the end caps, the pair weighs 167.5 grams.

Used once a while back.\n\nFor medium sized male.  Knee pads are medium.  Elbow pads are XL (they run small).\n\nPerfectly shaped soft elbow guards with SAS-TEC foam inserts and low-friction Kevlar skins for all day riding. Seriously comfortable and effective protection. t.h.e. Maxi Guards.\n\nViscoelastic foam insert made by SAS-TEC meets and exceeds European motorcycle safety standard EN 1621-1.\n\nTHE Maxi Knee Pads Features:\n\nSAS-TEC viscoelastic insert foam\nAnatomical shape\nPre-articulated (elbows)\nEVA side-impact foam\nLow-friction Kevlar outer\nVentilated neoprene inner-sleeves\nSilicone grips prevent slipping/rotating\nExceeds EN1621-1 motorcycle certification\n\nAbout SAS-TEC Foam:\n\nViscoelastic foam with memory effect: After an impact or any kind of deformation the foam (protector) returns to its original shape within shortly.\nMulti impact compliant: Unlike many other dampening materials (such as styrofoam (EPS), silicone or foam of inferior quality) our PU-foam is multi-impact compliant. Thus impacts or high pressure do not destroy the protector even when the same area is affected repeatedly. The protector keeps its full functional capability.\nExcellent residual forces: The CE-approved protectors of SAS-TEC remain up to 50 per cent below the legal values of the norm EN 1621.\nLightweight: high absorbability despite low density. Hard shell protectors or materials containing silicone are considerably more heavy which reduces the wearing comfort. The density of our SAS-TEC foam is about 280 g/l, hard shells in contrast have an average density of 1050 g/l.\nAdaptive absorption: The air which is embedded in the foam's cells provoke a progressive absorption. The protector remains soft in case of slowly increasing forces, however when it comes to a fast heavy impact the resistance of the foam grows with increasing speed.\nIn impulse responding behavior: Contrary to hard shell protectors, styrofoam damper or many other dampening materials, SAS-TEC foam reacts promptly and without any time delay even to minor impacts. The energy absorption goes almost linear, which keeps the impact forces to the human body at a low level.\nEnvironmental compatibility: The raw materials for our foam production are partly made of renewable materials. It is therefore possible to dispose of the protectors with the regular household garbage.\nLong product life: Some manufacturers of body protection only indicate a product life of two to three years for their articles, whereas SAS-TEC foam comes with a life expectancy of ten years.\nTemperature stability: Due to a special mixture SAS-TEC foam resists temperatures of approx. 100\u00b0C. Conventional PU-foam is only able to stand temperatures of approx. 60\u00b0C without taking damage.\nComfort: The high flexibility of our foam ensures outstanding comfort.\nWashable (hand wash): The cell structure of our SAS-TEC foam keeps water from entering the material \u2014 the water absorption is below one per cent. Therefore hand wash can be recommended without hesitation.\n\nBuy THE Maxi Knee Pads from Chain Reaction Cycles, the worlds largest online bicycle store    ", "Address": ""},

Along with a Tecno 3 system, you get the famed Sidi fit and performance you expect from the Italian company. The top strap and buckle is the ratcheting, multi-adjust Caliper system with the Soft Instep 2 pad that distributes even, comfortable pressure over the top of the ankle for secure fit and exceptional comfort. Sidi's reinforced heel retention system is famous for it's anatomic heel cup and stable hold.\n\nThe composite carbon Millennium 4 sole features a base matrix of the Nylon, which is then injected with carbon fiber. This make it much stiffer than a Nylon sole (especially over time and use), but not quite as stiff as the top end carbon soles. Many riders actually prefer this design, feeling it more forgiving and in tune with the upper. In the end, you get great performance, comfort and power transfer without the high cost of the stiffest carbon sole. The three-bolt delta style cleat interface is standard with the Millennium 4, as are the firm toe tap, and soft replaceable heel pad\n\nPerhaps the best feature of the Kaos the Tecno 3 closure system. Sidi's high-end retention system is used to ensure a sung, comfortable fit on the fore and mid foot. This single ratchet pulls the Sidi Wire system from the metatarsal bridge to just below the Soft Instep 2 pad. You get a proven retention system that delivers an uncompromising fit, and fully takes advantage of the supple synthetic upper. Tecno 3 is micro-adjustable and secure, and just as with the Caliper system, replacements are always available. Sidi shoes are known for superior fit, longevity, and Italian style, and the Kaos is no exception.\n\nDetails\n\nPerformance road shoe with exceptional features, standard Sidi width\nCaliper buckle and strap, with Soft Instep 2 pad\nTecno 3 closure system for fore and mid foot secure, comfortable fit\nComposite Nylon-Carbon sole with toe tap, and replaceable heel pad\nDelta-style, three-bolt cleat interface delivers power transfer across sole\nSidi Heel Cup delivers excellent retention, security, comfort and protection    ", "Address": "dublin / pleasanton / livermore"},

Incredibly light, stiff and comfortable- these bars absorb alot of vibrations from the road.  Shallow drop, short reach. Slightly flattened tops and with a slight backward angle that makes them more wrist friendly. The bars have a groove in the underside to make cable routing clean. These are great, comfortable bars, the only reason I am selling them is that I am trying narrower bars in the same model.\n\nRitchey WCS Trail Carbon Riser Bar (15 mm rise 9 degree Sweep) 31.8 Clamp area \nThis sells for 180 at Jenson- The bar has been cut down to 600mm, so I will sell it for $85. This is a stiff, light and comfortable, premium carbon handlebar.  \n\nEriksen Titanium Seatpost (AKA the \"Sweetpost\") 27.2 20 mm 360 mm length layback $160 \nThis a a beautiful, functional seatpost with just the right amount of flex.

They have never been used and are new.  Rear hose is 64\".  Front hose is 31\".  Bar mounts included.\n\nDescription\n\nSUPERIOR SLOWDOWN.\n\nSitting with cool confidence and authority atop SRAM's Guide line, the Guide RSC (B1) Disc Brake represents the best of the Guide hydraulic disc family, offering Lever reach adjustment, SRAM's new SwingLink lever design, and Contact point adjustment capability \u2014 abbreviated to create to the RSC distinction.\nThe Guide RSC's SwingLink levers are one of the biggest features setting it apart from its more straightforward siblings. SRAM designed them to react faster and with less force than earlier brakes, reducing the size of the lever \"deadspot\" with a new cam design. You'll feel more in-control as you whip around a corner and squeeze the levers to stay in control over a burly rock garden, and as soon as you do engage the levers, an efficient cup-seal timing port closes the port to pressurize the system and force the pads to the rotor for perfect, immediate modulation. SRAM also made the contact point easy to access, just behind the lever attachment to the master cylinder, so you can dial in the right feel for the brakes without having to perform complex mechanics.\nSRAM pairs the Guide RSC with its powerful 4-piston, dual 14- and 16mm diameter caliper, built with its Bleeding Edge technology to ensure fluid passes easily through it for a more efficient bleeding process. Once you're done, a specifically-adapted S4 bleed adapter sits in the bleed port and guards the system against air contamination and fluid loss. The caliper comes with SRAM's steel-backed organic pads, whose forged aluminum construction promises long-term durability, with easy pad removable via a top-loading design.\nPlease note that compatible Centerline rotors are sold separately, with the Guide RSC (B1) Disc Brake coming as a Front/left or Rear/right lever and caliper configuration. Additionally, the lever assembly is Matchmaker-compatible, which allows you to run your various controls cleanly from a single lever clamp.\n\nSRAM's top-end mountain bike hydraulic disc brake\n\nAdjustable lever reach and pad contact\n\nImproved modulation and quicker engagement\n\nFacilitates easy bleeding with less contamination\n\n    ", "Address": "concord / pleasant hill / martinez"},

The first big thing is the weight. At a claimed 1.85lbs, it's less than half the weight of most track pumps. The second thing is the reduced height. It's 20 inches tall. And the overall package is shallower at 2.3 inches and narrower at 7.5 inches. Small touches make a difference when cramming as much gear as possible in a small space, so that the hose is a shade under 20 inches and it is in line with the gauge and barrel is a great thing. The gauge has been narrowed to a diameter of 1.5in to take up less space as well.One place where you'll find no changes is at the chuck. It still has the Flip Chuck with ABS bleed valve, so you can pump up both Schrader and Presta tubes. The included Speed Chuck is a great add-on for people who prefer slip-on pump chucks. It also sports a 90-degree angle, so it can fit in the valve port of disc wheels. The Lezyne CNC Travel Floor Drive Pump measures 20 x 7.5 x 2.3in (508 x 190 x 60mm). The handle is 9.5in. The claimed weight is 1.85lbs (.84kg). The interior diameter of the barrel is 28mm, which means the pump has been optimized for high pressure applications. The pump comes with its own travel bag. The color is anodized high-polished aluminum.\n\nProduct Features\n\nMaterial: CNC-machined aluminum\nDimensions: 20 x 7.4 x 2.3 in\nValve Type: Presta, Schrader\nMax Pressure: 160 PSI 11 bar\nHose Length:\nDeflate: yes, ABS (Air Bleed Equipped)\nWeight: 1.85 lbs\nRecommended Use: tire inflation for globetrotters    ", "Address": "emeryville"},

Large lens! Impact resistant! This mirror is brand new and in its original, never opened box!\n\nThe only rear view mirror designed specifically for Shimano Sti road levers\nAttaches to either the left or right hand lever\nFolds out of the way when not needed\nWide field of view adjustable to any viewing angle\n**The Road Mirror is not compatible with STI levers that have brake lever clips that have the open space** (spring 2010 and newer)\nThe all-new Mirrycle Road Mirror was developed exclusively to fit Shimano STI* shifter/brake levers while allowing the continued comfortable use of the lever. With a minimum of included parts, the Road Mirror is ingeniously engineered to fit many different STI levers. A lot of emphasis has been placed on the design of the Mirrycle Road Mirror so it blends elegantly with today's bicycle components.\n\nTo mount the mirror, pull the top of the rubber hood off the STI lever clip, slip the mirror base over the lever clip, and place the rubber hood back onto the clip we've cleverly integrated into the mirror base. When mounted on the lever, the Mirrycle Road Mirror is located in the very best position for viewing to the rear. Just a flick of your eyes allows for a quick view behind. The Mirrycle Road Mirror can be attached to either the left or right side lever. All necessary tools are included.\n\nThe mirror part is a 3\" diameter round glass convex mirror with a wide field of view.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE:\n\nThe Road Mirror is NOT compatible with STI levers that have brake lever clips that have the open space as shown at left.\n\nThe Road Mirror will NOT fit on most Shimano STI levers installed on bikes after Spring 2010. The best way to determine if the mirror will fit your brake lever is to view the Assembly Instructions ONLINE and see if your lever has a brake lever clip similar to the one shown in the instructions.\n\nI DO NOT SHIP ANYTHING ANYWHERE, SO PLEASE DO NOT ASK. LOCAL PICKUP ONLY PLEASE.\n\nIf you are interested in this item please feel free to call Randy at:  \n\n\n    ", "Address": "alameda"},

It also features our hand hammered copper rivets. The B15 Swallow is a faithful reproduction of a saddle specifically conceived with the sporting cyclist in mind, the result being a timeless design widely regarded as the precursor of all modern racing saddles. This saddle was originally patented as long ago as 1937. At that time a great many such Brooks Saddles were exported to the continent, where they were very popular amongst professional cyclists competing in the various tours and stage races. Today's Swallow still proudly bears the original patent declaration on the tensioning plate beneath the svelte leather upper. This text retains the word \"depose\", the patent application for the Swallow having initially been registered in the Paris patent office.\n\n*Features & details*\n- HANDMADE IN ENGLAND: Manufactured with the same patent principle from 1937 and 100 year old traditional techniques.\n- EXTRA TOUGH LEATHER: Brooks uses extra tough, vegetable tanned leather to construct the B15 Select.\n- COPPER RIVETS: The 100% copper rivets are all hand hammered for increased quality.\n- TIMELESS DESIGN: The B15 Swallow is a faithful reproduction, specifically conceived with the sporting cyclist in mind.\n- ROAD/MTB: Versatile and comfortable, use the B15 Swallow on your road or mountain bike.
