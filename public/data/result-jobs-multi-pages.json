The rim is 36h, unbranded, double wall. Red nipples match the hub. It has a Shimano 16t freewheel. Its bar end shifter is included. Rear spacing is 120mm (typical fixed gear width).\n\nI bought this wheel installed to what used to be a fixed gear bike, and it rides wonderfully smooth, but it's just not my style. After riding it a bit, I pulled the wheel and shifter, checked it for true and spoke tension, and put it up for sale. The previous owner said he had never used the fixed threads or a lockring, so I assume them to be in good condition. I don't have the tool to remove the freewheel so I can't verify- if you own one, bring it with you and we can check. I have this complete wheel and shifter priced well under a listing for just the hub on ebay.\n\nI may be willing to trade for other bicycle parts or videogaming, home entertainment or computer stuff. I'm located in Vacaville. Thanks for looking!    ", "Address": "fairfield / vacaville"},
