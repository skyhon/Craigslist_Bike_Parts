Qubo frame is easy to setup, since roller pressure is automatically determined by rider weight -- no calibration required! Progressive fluid resistance changes as you pedal faster or slower, giving you the same smooth performance you feel on the road.

Hoods and everything else are in great condition.  \n\nI\u2019m also selling the Cane Creek ee Cycleworks Ultralight direct mount brakes on another post and I can package them as a deal if you\u2019re interested, otherwise cash is preferred.\n\nI\u2019d like to meet in a public place in the South Bay if possible.

Details and specs here: https://bythehive.com/products/trs-seatpost\n\nIt's spring loaded and fully serviceable by the user at home. Lot's of folks in the colder climates tend to like this post because it won't get slow or stop in winter like the hydraulic ones. It can also handle wet weather better than a hydraulic post. Post includes the lever and the cable and housing that was installed in the bike. The lever clam is for a Sram matchmaker set up. So the configuration I received the post was the lever was bolted onto a Sram Guide Brake clamp via a matchmaker adapter which will come with the sale of the post. If you don't have Sram brakes then you may need to purchase a clam from E Thirteen to connect to your bars. All is in great shape. Post retails for $280. Fair offers and cash only.

Perhaps you like more surface area than the standard XT pedals offer. These Shimano XT PD-M785 Pedals have an integral cage that gives you a greater area to hit when you have to \"stab\" at them in the heat of the moment. You'll also be able to count on more support for your foot as you pedal. If you ride in anything softer than uber-stiff carbon soled shoes, this is where you'll notice the greatest benefit.As usual, the workhorse XT parts get some trickledown from Shimano's flagship XTR line. The shape of the cage is very similar to the more expensive XTR parts; and at a glance, they look identical. The retention mechanism functions exactly the same. For your hard-earned dollars, there is no comparison for XT pedals. They'll always give you the best performance-per-dollar. The key difference is seen on the gram scale. XTR is significantly lighter thanks to their use of higher grade materials and subtle trimming of excess fat. And for this caged version, you'll gain about 30 grams per pedal over the standard-sized XT PD-M780 Pedals. Like all other Shimano SPD pedals, it's a two-sided design so you can have easy access with the stomp of your foot. The two-bolt SH-51 cleats (included) have 4 degrees of float to allow some movement in your ankle as you pedal. The Shimano XT PD-M785 Pedals are Dark Grey and have an aluminum body that relies on sealed cartridge bearings to spin on a plated chromoly axle. The retention mechanism can be adjusted on both sides to accommodate your preferred release tension.    ", "Address": "rohnert pk / cotati"},

I have these in black and silver.\n\n\n\nFeatures:\nIntegrated USB Charger\n\nCharge your phone, GPS, or any other USB device directly from the Beacon; no need for a separate charger.\n\nFlexible Power Options\n\nAn external, off-the-shelf USB battery pack can be connected to maintain bright, flicker-free light even when stopped or riding slowly. Any available dynamo power replaces battery power until reaching a speed when all power is provided by the dynamo and the battery is no longer used.\n\n750 Lumens\n\nLots of light, suitable for any style of riding.\n\nSymmetrical Beam Pattern\n\nIdeal choice for off-road riding.\n\nSuperior brightness at low and medium speeds\n\nDynamo power is optimized at low-to-medium speeds, reaching 200 lumens at just 5 MPH, 500 lumens at 8 MPH, 650 lumens at 10 MPH, and 750 lumens at 13 MPH.\n\nCharger Priority Mode\n\nIntelligently balances power between light and charger to optimize simultaneous use.\n\nStandlight\n\nA supercapacitor, charged while riding, provides about 5 minutes of standlight when stopped.\nMounting Options\n\nThe 10mm mounting tab is compatible with mounting hardware from B&M, Supernova, Schmidt, etc.\n\nCompact Design\n\nL x W x H - 58 x 42 x 42mm\n115g (includes 36\" dynamo wire)\nBetter Color Temperature\n\nWhile still in the \"cool white\" range, the Beacon generates slightly warmer light than other LED headlights. This results in less glare, less strain on your eyes, and does a better job reproducing natural colors.\n\nWeatherproof\n\nDesigned to be used in any conditions. Multiple seals protect against water ingress, electronics are potted in epoxy, and all connectors are gold plated and designed for resistance to the elements.\n\nMade in the USA\n\nAll Sinewave products are made in the USA. The Beacon is the only commercially available dynamo light made in the USA.\n\nWarranty\n\n3 years\n\nWhat's in the box?\n\nThe Beacon comes with a USB-to-DC cable.\nA mount is not included - there are many options available for different mounting locations.

Our Aim was simple: we wanted to make good quality products that were easy to use and came fully assembled. We earned a great reputation fast and soon began selling our racks to other bike shops throughout California. By the late '70s, we began selling our racks to bicycle companies such as Schwinn, Peugeot and nishiki. In 1981, we closed the bike shop and opened a small factory in los angeles, CA to exclusively make car racks, then relocated to a larger facility in 1988. In 1989, we began exporting our products to Europe, and in the 1990's we expanded our line to include racks for trailer hitches, pickup trucks and spare tires. We have since relocated our offices, R and d and us warehouse to our present facility in the los angeles area with manufacturing in Taiwan. Our products are available in all 50 States and in over 25 countries worldwide.\n\n\n\nDesigned in 1973, The F1B 3-Bike Rack from Hollywood Racks is the original fully pre-assembled and foldable trunk rack that works on most sedans, vans, and SUVs.

Equipped with an integrated tie-down strap for extra security, the F1B Rack holds up to three bikes with generous 14.5-inch spacing in between to prevent bike-on-bike damage.

With its unidirectional carbon construction (with exception of final cosmetic layer), 3.6 mm stack height, industry leading strength to weight ratio and Bont\u2019s proprietary resin allowing customization of fit, the a-one will ensure that your power is transferred straight to the drive train without waste.\n\n\nHeat Molding Process \n\nThis cycling boot is the most heat mold-able boot on the market today. Bonts\u2019 resin is developed in house and has been perfected over 35 years to be an extremely stiff resin that becomes pliable at relatively low temperatures. The base of the boot is mold-able which means all stiff areas of the boot can be molded in a standard oven. You do not need to mold your boots if they fit you straight out of the box. \n\nTo mold your boots, remove any cleats, laces or cleat mounting screws and innersole before molding. Failure to remove the innersole can result in it becoming deformed by the heat. Pre heat the oven to 70C/160F. Place the boot in the oven for 20 minutes. Higher temperatures will void your warranty and may damage your boot. \n\nCaution: Do not place your feet in the hot boots or you may burn your feet. Let them cool a little and test the boot temperature with your hand before placing your feet in the boots. Tighten the straps and allow to cool. If you have any lumps or bunions on your feet or if there are any areas causing discomfort, while the boot is hot you can use the round end of a screwdriver to press out any part of the boot. You can heat mold the boots as many times as you like.\n\nSpecifications\n\nBrand\tBont\nModel A-One\nSize 39 EU  / 6 US\nColor\tWhite with Black\nWeight (g)\t503\nFastening Type\tVelcro\n\nThanks for looking!

Along with a Tecno 3 system, you get the famed Sidi fit and performance you expect from the Italian company. The top strap and buckle is the ratcheting, multi-adjust Caliper system with the Soft Instep 2 pad that distributes even, comfortable pressure over the top of the ankle for secure fit and exceptional comfort. Sidi's reinforced heel retention system is famous for it's anatomic heel cup and stable hold.\n\nThe composite carbon Millennium 4 sole features a base matrix of the Nylon, which is then injected with carbon fiber. This make it much stiffer than a Nylon sole (especially over time and use), but not quite as stiff as the top end carbon soles. Many riders actually prefer this design, feeling it more forgiving and in tune with the upper. In the end, you get great performance, comfort and power transfer without the high cost of the stiffest carbon sole. The three-bolt delta style cleat interface is standard with the Millennium 4, as are the firm toe tap, and soft replaceable heel pad\n\nPerhaps the best feature of the Kaos the Tecno 3 closure system. Sidi's high-end retention system is used to ensure a sung, comfortable fit on the fore and mid foot. This single ratchet pulls the Sidi Wire system from the metatarsal bridge to just below the Soft Instep 2 pad. You get a proven retention system that delivers an uncompromising fit, and fully takes advantage of the supple synthetic upper.

Elbow pads are XL (they run small).\n\nPerfectly shaped soft elbow guards with SAS-TEC foam inserts and low-friction Kevlar skins for all day riding. Seriously comfortable and effective protection. t.h.e. Maxi Guards.\n\nViscoelastic foam insert made by SAS-TEC meets and exceeds European motorcycle safety standard EN 1621-1.\n\nTHE Maxi Knee Pads Features:\n\nSAS-TEC viscoelastic insert foam\nAnatomical shape\nPre-articulated (elbows)\nEVA side-impact foam\nLow-friction Kevlar outer\nVentilated neoprene inner-sleeves\nSilicone grips prevent slipping/rotating\nExceeds EN1621-1 motorcycle certification\n\nAbout SAS-TEC Foam:\n\nViscoelastic foam with memory effect: After an impact or any kind of deformation the foam (protector) returns to its original shape within shortly.\nMulti impact compliant: Unlike many other dampening materials (such as styrofoam (EPS), silicone or foam of inferior quality) our PU-foam is multi-impact compliant. Thus impacts or high pressure do not destroy the protector even when the same area is affected repeatedly. The protector keeps its full functional capability.\nExcellent residual forces: The CE-approved protectors of SAS-TEC remain up to 50 per cent below the legal values of the norm EN 1621.\nLightweight: high absorbability despite low density. Hard shell protectors or materials containing silicone are considerably more heavy which reduces the wearing comfort. The density of our SAS-TEC foam is about 280 g/l, hard shells in contrast have an average density of 1050 g/l.\nAdaptive absorption: The air which is embedded in the foam's cells provoke a progressive absorption. The protector remains soft in case of slowly increasing forces, however when it comes to a fast heavy impact the resistance of the foam grows with increasing speed.\nIn impulse responding behavior: Contrary to hard shell protectors, styrofoam damper or many other dampening materials, SAS-TEC foam reacts promptly and without any time delay even to minor impacts. The energy absorption goes almost linear, which keeps the impact forces to the human body at a low level.\nEnvironmental compatibility: The raw materials for our foam production are partly made of renewable materials. It is therefore possible to dispose of the protectors with the regular household garbage.\nLong product life: Some manufacturers of body protection only indicate a product life of two to three years for their articles, whereas SAS-TEC foam comes with a life expectancy of ten years.\nTemperature stability: Due to a special mixture SAS-TEC foam resists temperatures of approx. 100\u00b0C. Conventional PU-foam is only able to stand temperatures of approx. 60\u00b0C without taking damage.\nComfort: The high flexibility of our foam ensures outstanding comfort.\nWashable (hand wash): The cell structure of our SAS-TEC foam keeps water from entering the material \u2014 the water absorption is below one per cent. Therefore hand wash can be recommended without hesitation.\n\nBuy THE Maxi Knee Pads from Chain Reaction Cycles, the worlds largest online bicycle store    ", "Address": ""},

I'm selling it because I accidentally ordered the wrong size for my bikes' seat-posts. If you're not familiar with seat post pumps, this is an ingenious way to hide a pump functionally in the framework of a bicycle, while making it even more usable by employing the seat itself as the pump handle. With the added benefit that there's no obvious bike pump strapped to the frame where it can come loose or fall off while riding, or be easily stolen if left in place while the bike is parked. Plus the seat post size is much larger than the standard mini-pump sizes, making quicker & easier work of the pumping as well. (Bicycle seat itself not included -- this works like standard seat posts with any standard bicycle seats.)\n\nAs the manufacturer, Biologic, says: \n\"Never forget your bike pump at home again. The BioLogic PostPump 31.6mm seatpost is an ingenious combination of a seatpost and powerful floor pump. The pump mechanism is hidden inside the seatpost and uses the seatpost as the outer wall of the pump. Go over 100 psi in less than half the strokes of the best mini-pumps. The PostPump is always ready, hidden from the elements and thieves.\"\n\nJust make sure that you have a bike with a 31.6mm seat post, which isn't a standard size -- not that there is one standard size, anyway. But if you have a foldable bike like a newer Dahon or a Tern, you may have the right-sized seat post for this seat post pump to fit. Just measure the diameter of your current seat post (or of the post-opening in the frame) to check it out.\n\nCash only please.    ", "Address": "alameda"},

Large lens! Impact resistant! This mirror is brand new and in its original, never opened box!\n\nThe only rear view mirror designed specifically for Shimano Sti road levers\nAttaches to either the left or right hand lever\nFolds out of the way when not needed\nWide field of view adjustable to any viewing angle\n**The Road Mirror is not compatible with STI levers that have brake lever clips that have the open space** (spring 2010 and newer)\nThe all-new Mirrycle Road Mirror was developed exclusively to fit Shimano STI* shifter/brake levers while allowing the continued comfortable use of the lever. With a minimum of included parts, the Road Mirror is ingeniously engineered to fit many different STI levers. A lot of emphasis has been placed on the design of the Mirrycle Road Mirror so it blends elegantly with today's bicycle components.\n\nTo mount the mirror, pull the top of the rubber hood off the STI lever clip, slip the mirror base over the lever clip, and place the rubber hood back onto the clip we've cleverly integrated into the mirror base. When mounted on the lever, the Mirrycle Road Mirror is located in the very best position for viewing to the rear. Just a flick of your eyes allows for a quick view behind. The Mirrycle Road Mirror can be attached to either the left or right side lever. All necessary tools are included.\n\nThe mirror part is a 3\" diameter round glass convex mirror with a wide field of view.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE:\n\nThe Road Mirror is NOT compatible with STI levers that have brake lever clips that have the open space as shown at left.\n\nThe Road Mirror will NOT fit on most Shimano STI levers installed on bikes after Spring 2010. The best way to determine if the mirror will fit your brake lever is to view the Assembly Instructions ONLINE and see if your lever has a brake lever clip similar to the one shown in the instructions.\n\nI DO NOT SHIP ANYTHING ANYWHERE, SO PLEASE DO NOT ASK. LOCAL PICKUP ONLY PLEASE.\n\nIf you are interested in this item please feel free to call Randy at:  \n\n\n    ", "Address": "alameda"},

THESE BICYCLES ALMOST NEVER COME UP FOR SALE! \n\nHistory: \nRon Cooper started building frames for Gillotts of London around 1950. He opened his own London shop in 1971, and continued to build the highest quality frames for an extremely demanding and exclusive clientele until his death in 2012.  That is well over 60 years of frame-building experience.  -- The build date of this frame is unknown, but (based on stylistic elements and materials) it is probably late-1980s through mid-1990s. \n\nSerial number 284. \n\nThis frameset is built with Reynolds 531 double-butted tubing. The lug-work is impeccable and refined. The frame is extremely light. It was professionally measured and aligned before being repainted. \n\nThe frameset has been custom repainted in an absolutely elegant \u201cIce Blue\u201d that compliments the Cooper graphics beautifully. The frameset has not been built up since re-painting, but displayed for a while in my office. However, the frame does not fit me, and I cannot justify keeping it as a beautiful \u201cwall-hanger\u201d any longer. \n\nThe paint and graphics are in near-mint condition. There are slight imperfections in the frame/finish: a barely perceptible indentation in the top tube, a small dent in the side of drive-side fork, and a minor imperfection in the paint finish on the inside of the other fork. These issues are shown in the photos. They in no way detract from the frame\u2019s beauty or functionality. \n\nMeasurements: \nSeat Tube: 58cm/approx. 23\u201d center to top // 57cm center to center\nTop Tube: 56cm \nRear Spacing: 126mm\nSeat Tube: 27.2mm \nBottom Bracket: 68mm shell with 1.37\u201d x 24tpi threading \nHeadset (INCLUDED): Tange Levin steel headset (high-quality, Campagnolo Record look-alike)  \n\n$400 OBO \n\n\nFYI: I restore vintage steel bicycles to their original glory as a hobby. I charge only for the parts and materials I have in the bike. I do not charge for my many hours of labor, including custom, hand-rubbed paint jobs.  I have restored over three dozen vintage bicycles in the last five years.  Many of those have been ridden at L\u2019Eroica California. \n\n\nWHEN RESPONDING, PLEASE LEAVE YOUR NAME AND A PHONE/TEXT NMBER. I DO NOT RESPOND TO ONLINE OR EMAIL OFFERS. TOO MANY JOKERS OUT THERE. THANK YOU. \n\nTHE BIKE IS LOCATED IN WALNUT CREEK. \nIF IT IS MORE CONVENIENT FOR THE BUYER TO MEET AT WALNUT CREEK BART, I CAN DO SO. \n\nKey Words: Eroica, Cinelli, Guerciotti, Campagnolo, Italian, Vintage, Classic, Bianchi, Ciocc, Pinarello, Colnago, Masi, Merckx, Frejus, Legnano, lugged, classic, classical  \n\n\n    ", "Address": "walnut creek"},

The Minion DHF was designed for the loose and muddy conditions that riders often encounter. The DHF incorporates ramped knobs for low rolling resistance and channel-cut knobs to increase gripping edges to deliver straight-line control and precise cornering. When this is combined with a single ply casing you get an incredibly aggressive all mountain tire in a lightweight package that excels in loose and loose over hard pack trail conditions. \n\nFeatures: \n\nTUBELESS READY: Tubeless tires provide the rider with many benefits: the ability to run lower air pressures, which improves traction; lower rolling resistance when compared to a tube-type tire; and less chance of flatting since there is no tube. Maxxis Tubeless Ready (TR) tires provide the benefits of a UST tubeless tire without the weight penalty. TR tires use a standard casing and require the use of a liquid sealant in order to make them airtight. Maxxis Tubeless Ready tires are the only Maxxis tires approved for use with liquid sealants. Using a liquid sealant in any non-TR Maxxis tire will void the warranty.\n3C TRIPLE COMPOUND - MOUNTAIN: Maxxis 3C Triple Compound mountain technology uses a harder, longer lasting base layer and two progressively softer top layers in order to optimize traction and stability. Maxxis offers three different configurations of 3C Triple Compound mountain technology: Maxx Speed, Maxx Terra and Maxx Grip.\nMAXX TERRA: An intermediate compound configuration used in select mountain tires. 3C Maxx Terra is softer and offers more traction than 3C Maxx Speed, yet provides better treadwear and less rolling resistance than Maxx Griip\n    ", "Address": "campbell"},
